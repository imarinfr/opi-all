Description: This is an alternate branch of the the Open Perimetry Interface (OPI) package for simulating and controlling visual field machines using R; see that package for more information.  This branch is not backwards compatibile with OPI, hence its publication as OPI3.  It's primary purpose is to make use of the JOVP psychophysics library to facilitate perimetry on displays such as phones, tablets, vr headsets and so on rather than projection-based or led-based perimeters.  Currently it supports the ImoVifa (Tempo), Compass, MAIA and any screen-based perimeter. We will eventaully add Octopus, Kowa, etc from the OPI package.
